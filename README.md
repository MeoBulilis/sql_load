# SQL Data Analyst Project

This project is inspired by what I have learned from Luke Barousseâ€™s YouTube video tutorial on SQL for Data Analysts.  
I followed along and practiced writing SQL queries to analyze job postings data, focusing on skills demand and salary insights.  

A big thanks to [Luke Barousse](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse) for creating and sharing such valuable learning resources!

# Background
Guided by Luke Barousseâ€™s video, this project was driven by the goal of navigating the data analyst job market more effectively.  
It was designed to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, helping streamline the process of finding optimal jobs.  

The key questions framed in the video and explored through SQL queries were:

- What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
- What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?  
- What skills are most in demand for data analysts?  
- Which skills are associated with higher salaries?  
- What are the most optimal skills to learn?  

# Tools Used

- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing job postings data.  
- **Postgres**: The database system used to store and manage the dataset.  
- **VS Code**: As the development environment for writing and testing SQL queries.  
- **Git and GitHub**: For version control and sharing the project.  

# Database Schema

The project is built on a relational database consisting of four main tables:

- **job_postings_fact**: Contains detailed job posting information such as title, location, schedule type, posting date, work-from-home, and salary data.  
- **company_dim**: Stores information about companies, including company id, website links.  
- **skills_job_dim**: Acts as a bridge table linking job postings with specific skills.  
- **skills_dim**: Contains the list of skills (e.g., SQL, Python, Excel) and their associated types.  

These tables are connected through primary and foreign keys to enable efficient querying and analysis of job postings and skill requirements.

# The Analysis

## Query 1: Top-Paying Remote Data Analyst Jobs  

This query answers the question: *What are the top-paying remote Data Analyst jobs?*  

It retrieves the top 10 highest-paying job postings with details such as job title, location, schedule type, posting date, salary, and company name.  
The query filters for Data Analyst roles with a location set to "Anywhere" (remote) and non-null salary values, then orders the results by average yearly salary in descending order.  


```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
- **Mantys** offers the highest-paying position with an average yearly salary of **$650,000**, standing out as an outlier.  
- **Meta** and **AT&T** also rank highly, with salaries of **$336,500** and **$255,829.5**, respectively.  
- Other companies such as **Pinterest**, **Uclahealthcareers**, and **SmartAsset** offer competitive salaries ranging from **$232,000â€“$205,000**.  
- The remaining roles cluster between **$180,000â€“$190,000**, reflecting strong opportunities for senior or principal analyst positions.

*Bar graph visualizing the average salary for the top 10 salaries for data analysts; the query results were exported into a csv file and the graph was generated through excel*

## Query 2: Skills needed for top paying data analyst jobs
This query answers the question: *What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?*  

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```


**SQL** and **Python** dominate the top-paying data roles, appearing in nearly every high-salary job (8 and 7 mentions, respectively). This shows they are considered core, indispensable skills.

**Tableau** appeared 6 times. It's presence shows that data visualization and dashboarding skills are highly valued at the top end of the salary range.

R appears a few times, mostly in roles tied to statistical analysis and marketing analytics.

Specialized tools like Azure, Databricks, and Crystal show up only once, suggesting they are niche requirements depending on company tech stacks.
